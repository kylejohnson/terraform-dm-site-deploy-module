# Overview
This module is used to deploy sites, such as theone and domainmarket.
A "site" is a collection of AWS resources, such as autoscaling groups, launch
configurations, and load balancers, as well as the code that runs on the ec2
instances inside of an autoscaling group.

This module is currently designed around deploying legacy sites?
